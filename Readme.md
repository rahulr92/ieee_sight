IEEE SIGHT Click, comment and share app
=================================

This is an app designed for IEEE SIGHT (www.ieeesight.com) using which IEEE members can raise awareness about Humanitarian concerns. This app helps them leverage the power of social networks to spread the awareness and build a team of volunteers interested in vorking on the concern. A voting system helps members show their support for a concern and participate in the process of determining the priority of concerns. Afterwards, an expert panel from IEEE will review the top rated concerns and provide technical and financial support in soving them.

Designed and developed by Rahul R, College of Engineering Trivandrum (2010-14), IEEE SB CET volunteer.
